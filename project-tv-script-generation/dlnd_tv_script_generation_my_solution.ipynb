    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",

    "\n",

    "* Sequence length should be long enough to describe current dialog context. The large length - slower to train but results could have more sense. I tried 15, 25 and 100 words context. Average dialog line was about 5 words, so 15 words could cover several dialog lines and get common dialog structure. There is no requirement on having much sense in this dialogs, so we don't need to keep long discussion context for training. Large sequence length converges slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Num epochs - started with large (`30`) and than was looking when loss stops decreasing. 11-12 epochs is enough for final config to meet required minimal loss. My setting is `18` because model converged rather slow and I neede around 20 epochs, but then I increased number of hidden layers and it started converge faster. I decided not to rerun it again with 11-12 epoch because it requires about 2 GPU hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning rate - started with `0.01`, but loss function stopped decreasing around `4.6`. So I tried slightly less learning rate value and made it dependent on batch size. I had to change several hyper params so hard to say could I return back to `0.01` now, seems it isn't important for this example project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `hidden_dim` - `64` wasn't enough, training loss stopped decreasing at about 4.3. `128` and `256` worked better but still converged very slow. Finally `512` is good enough to get loss even loss less than `3.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_layers` - Normally 2-3 are suggested for LSTM. I've started with 2 it work pretty good. Tried `3` when model didn't converge but more effective was to increase hidden dim, not layers number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `embedding_dim` - we have only 21k words, in other examples we used 400 for 70k words, so I decided that 200k should be enough. I started with `100` but increased it at some moment when model didn't converge. According to general recommendations 50..200 should be ok for most cases.\n"
